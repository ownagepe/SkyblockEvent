# SkyblockEvent
An event plugin written for Ownage Skyblock
- In the event players would farm/grind to obtain as much money as possible
## If for some reason you want to use this plugin:
- In the directory the plugin creates after starting up called SBEvent you will need to place the world files for the Island you want players to have. The foldername containing the world files must be called base_island. Example path: /plugins/SBEvent/base_island/... level.dat + region folder.
- There needs to be a world called WaitingZone as thats where it'll try put players before the event starts
- There needs to be a world called skyblockspawn as thats where it'll try put players as soon as the event starts
